WHAT CAN A USER DO:
Like, rate, and review tv shows, down to the episode.

## Core features

### Interacting with stuff
A user can like, rate and review an episode, season or the entirety of a TV show itself,

> this would all be prompted at once

A user can choose when they have watched an episode.

A user can choose when they have started and finished a show.

> we could apply this to seasons

all of this can be changed at anytime

### A users Profile

A users profile would contain :
- a photo
- username
- *x* number of favorite tv shows
- recent activity
- ratings
- A graph that shows where all the reviews of a user falls

The profile will also have a list of what they have liked, and any lists they have created
> The formatting of the list may be confusing and complicated

#### Logging

A User will also be able to track the total number of episodes they have watched,
they will also be able to see how many episodes they have watched and are watching in the current year

The user can also see a timeline of that shows what they watched each year, separated by years and then into months.
selecting a year will bring up the months of that year. selecting on a month will bring up a calendar that dates an 
episode has been watched, if there is a date, where nothing was watched it will not be brought up.

> we could also log the "number of shows watched" using this exact system

### Lists

Lists are a collection of episodes, Tv Shows and seasons. Lists are NOT type locked 
> except for liked list, see 

a user can  create their own lists. The list will require:
- a name 
    >if a name is not given, the list would default to something like  "usernames" list 1, "usernames" list 2, etc.
- The user has the option to create a description for the list
- the user also has the option to create a description for each entry in the list
    >this allows the more hardcore tv enthusiasts to really spill their thoughts and give a deep analysis

### Interacting with other users

A user can like reviews left by other users, as well as add a reaction from a set of emoji's

> the set of emojis could contain the smile, sad, shocked, angry, sad, I think it creates a sense of community 

A user can look at another users profile and see what they have liked, their reviews and their lists.


## Features of the TV Show object

each screen of the show would contain:
- its cast and crew

    > it would include the role they played or what their job was
    
- studio
- synopsis
- rating
- number of seasons 
- total number of episodes 
- when the show started and ended
- tags
- A graph that shows where all teh reviews fall
- reviews

> If the show has roles that have been changed
> 
> it would show what years they were active for

Each show should have screenshots of scenes from the show.

The rating of the show would be based off the reviews of all the episodes in a show

> we could also rate the show in two other ways:
>- a rating based off of combing all the season ratings
>- and a rating based off a score that the user will give
> we could also apply this to seasons

> An example of a potential design could be, A square that has seasons, likes, Lists, Reviews(this would be consists of reviews of the entire show)

## Features of the season object

The features of the season object would be a near exact copy of the TV show object except for:
- the number of seasons
- the total number of episodes

and will feature the total number of episodes in the season object.
 

>A user should be able to back track from an episode to a season and its show, figure iut a way to make this possible

## Features of the episode object

The features of the episode object would be a near exact copy of the TV show object except for the total number of episodes.


## Home screen
> what dictates popularity is *x* amount of interactions in a *y* amount of hours

### Popular episodes/tv shows tab
This tab will include episodes or (Tv-shows) that are trending (have the most interactions within an arbitrary amount of time)
> If it's possible, lets try and find a way for it to contain episodes trending WORLDWIDE

### popular reviews
reviews that have gotten the most likes from across the userbase

### lists 
Would contain lists that are popular, as in has the most interactions (likes)


## Search capabilities PRIORITY
a user should be able to Search for a cast member / crew member and find what other productions they have been a part of.
It will say exactly what they did on that show and the years they did that role

when typing and entering something in search bar, we should get results that can be split up into 6 categories
- Shows
- Episodes
- Studios/companies
- users
- cast
- crew
  - crews can be filtered down to the role(maybe)
