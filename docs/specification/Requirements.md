 # Non-functional Requirements

## Data Integrity
Our database will use constraints to maintain accurate relationships between data. We will implement access controls to limit data modification to authorized personnel only, and encrypt sensitive information to protect against unauthorized access. These measures collectively ensure that the data remains accurate, reliable, and secure.
## Transparency
To ensure transparency, our application will provide clear, accessible information about how user reviews are aggregated and displayed. We will implement a transparent review calculation methodology, which will be documented and made available to all users. Also, we will include a feature where users can view the source of their own reviews and track the changes made to the review data. We will also maintain an open channel for user inquiries regarding review processes and calculation methods.
## Quality
Quality is our third non-functional requirement, we will ensure our application will be tested for performance benchmarks, maintain high reliability and availability, and ensure a user-friendly and accessible interface. Our application will be built with clean, maintainable code, robust security measures, and scalability to handle growth. We will implement effective error handling and recovery, and adjust to relevant industry standards and regulations. Continuous improvement will be driven by user feedback and performance metrics to keep the application up-to-date and effective.
